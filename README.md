# Missingness-visualization
This project was developed as part of my major project in final year of Newcastle University

This project utilized D3.js, an intermediate-level JavaScript library, to manipulate data and create dynamic visualizations of missingness. D3.js was used to construct interactive visualizations of the missingness for various categories of data, including but not limited to, temporal, geographic, and categorical. The visualizations allowed for easy identification of patterns and correlations in the missingness data, providing valuable insights to the team.
